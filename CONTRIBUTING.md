## Conventions

To ensure a standard level of quality

* We make heavy use of [NumPy-style](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_numpy.html) docstrings
* We use type annotations for clarity and for static type checking with [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/)
## PRs

PRs should be:

- as small as possible to get the job done
- add to or correct tests
- add to or correct documentation

### Submission

All PRs should be against `main`.
